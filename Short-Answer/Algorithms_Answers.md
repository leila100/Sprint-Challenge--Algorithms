#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n) because the loop will run only n times (when n is in this case n^3)

b)
O(nlog(n)) because the while loop runs only half of the n for every for loop

c)
O(n) because it will run for as long as bunnies is > 0 (n in this case is bunnies)
